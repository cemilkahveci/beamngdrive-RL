# beamngdrive-RL
This project focuses on training an autonomous driving agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within the high-fidelity soft-body physics environment of BeamNG.tech. By leveraging the BeamNGpy library and a custom OpenAI Gym (Gymnasium) environment, the agent was trained to perform complex driving tasks while interacting with realistic vehicle dynamics.
